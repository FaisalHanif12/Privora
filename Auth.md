✅ Phase 1.1 - Login & Signup (Frontend Only)
🎯 Goal:
Create Login and Signup screens with responsive design compatible with both Android & iOS using React Native and Styled Components (or Tailwind for RN if preferred).

🎨 Design Requirements:
Color Theme: As per provided brand guidelines.
Example (if not provided):

Primary: #2C3E50

Accent: #E74C3C

Background: #F9F9F9

Text: #333333

Typography: Use scalable units (based on Dimensions or react-native-responsive-fontsize).

Responsiveness: Use react-native-responsive-screen or Flexbox with % values and SafeAreaView.

📱 Screens to Build:
1. Login Screen
Email input

Password input

“Show/Hide” password toggle

Remember me checkbox

Login button (with loading state)

“Forgot Password?” link

Navigation to Signup

2. Signup Screen
Full Name input

Email input

Password input

Confirm Password input

Accept terms and conditions checkbox

Sign up button

Navigation to Login

🧠 UX Best Practices:
Form validation: Basic (empty fields, email format, password match)

Keyboard-aware scroll view: Prevent input from being hidden behind keyboard.

TouchableWithoutFeedback: To dismiss keyboard on tap outside.

Disabled state on buttons when fields are invalid or loading.
